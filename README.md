# DD2480 Group 7, 2025, CI (Assignment #2)

hello

This project is a continuous integration server. The server checks for commits in the repo, and automatically uses Maven for building and running the tests on that commit. If everything passes, the server sends a post request for setting a checkmark on the commit, to mark it as successful. Otherwise, it sets a red cross on the commit to mark it as unsuccessful. GitHub actions are enabled such that on each commit, there are two checkmarks which are synchronized. The server also has tests for checking that everything is working as expected. Additionally, there is a GitHub Actions workflow for building and publishing the javadoc API documentation to GitHub pages.

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

- Maven (see [Installing Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) or use your package manager).
- Java 17 or later (refer to your package manager).
- JUnit 5 (included in the Maven dependencies).
- Git (refer to your package manager).
- A GitHub app with a private key in PKCS8 format (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps)).

## Installation

Clone the repository locally using `git clone`.

You can then use Maven to compile, test and package the project. The Maven project is located in the `ciapp` subfolder, so navigate to that folder before running any Maven commands (`cd ciapp`).

To compile the project, run in the command line (from directory `ciapp`):

```bash
mvn clean package
```

To start the server, run in the command line (from directory `ciapp`):

```bash
java -jar target/ciapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Running the program with other config file

The configuration file [ciapp/src/main/resources/config.properties](ciapp/src/main/resources/config.properties) contains the default values for the server. If you want to use another configuration file, you can specify it with the `-Dconfig.file` flag. For example, if you have a configuration file in the parent directory called `config.properties`, you can run the program with the following command:

```bash
java -Dconfig.file=../config.properties -jar target/ciapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The configuration file specifies which repositories are allowed to be built by the server. The format of the file is as follows:

```properties
repos.list=https://github.com/dd2480-2025-group7/ci.git;ciapp/pom.xml
```

### Create private key and system environment variables

In order for the webserver to work correctly, a private key has to be obtained from the GitHub app. This key is however in the PKCS1 format which can not be read by the program. In order to convert the key to the readable PKCS8 format, paste the following command into the console while in the directory of the downloaded private key, replacing `original_key.pem` with the name of said downloaded key. The output will be a new file called `pkcs8_key.pem` which can be used by the program.

```bash
openssl pkcs8 \
    -topk8 \
    -inform PEM \
    -outform PEM \
    -in original_key.pem \
    -out pkcs8_key.pem \
    -nocrypt
```

Some system environment variables have to defined on the server in order for the program to run correctly, these include "PRIVATE_KEY_PATH", "APP_ID", "DATABASE_PATH", and "BASE_URL". Create an `.env` file with the contents.

```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = "Your private key file path" # pkcs8_key.pem in this case
export APP_ID = "The GitHub app id"
export DATABASE_PATH = "The database file path"
export BASE_URL = "The base url for the webserver"
```

## API documentation

The API documentation can be found at [https://dd2480-2025-group7.github.io/ci/](https://dd2480-2025-group7.github.io/ci/). 

You can also regenerate the API documentation yourself. To generate the API documentation move to the ciapp directory and run.

```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

The generated files can be found in ciapp - target - site - apidocs. 

## Build log 

The build log can be found [here](https://dd2480-ci-server.hejduk.se/).

## Notification Implementation

Notification of build results have been implemented by sending a API request to GitHub API, first to create a "check_run", that indicates that the build is in progress. Then, after the build is done, another API request is sent to update the "check_run" with either success or failure. The API requests are sent using the GitHub API and the GitHub app private key. We have unit tests for the notification implementation.

## Statement of Contributions

Each person has contributed to the project by creating issues, particpating in assigning issues among the group, writing code and creating pull requests, and reviewing other group members' pull requests. Reviews have been divided among the group members in a way that everyone has reviewed a fair share of the PRs and in a way that all group members have a solid knowledge of the codebase. A lot of the issues in this project was solved with pair programming and thus a lot of the commits have several contributors. We all spent rougly the same amount of time working on the project.

## SEMAT (Team assessment)

According to the checklist in [Essence standard](https://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/1.2/PDF) on p.52 we are in the "collaborating state". The team now know and trust each other. We all work effectively together and have a common goal that we want to achieve. 

To reach the next state "performing", the group needs to minimize the need for backtracking. We don't want to waste our time and work. Currently there are still some small needs for going back to already written code and correcting some small errors. The team has already reached some of the goals of this state, like working without outside help and continously meeting our commitments. 

## Motivation for P+

We believe that the group has fulfilled the requirements for P+.

- Nearly all commits are linked to an issue that describes the feature / commit.
- The group has worked well togehter in a proactive and creative way. Each group member is proud of the work that has been done.
- We keep the history of past builds in a database. This way the history is not lost when rebooting the server. This is the [link](https://dd2480-ci-server.hejduk.se/).
